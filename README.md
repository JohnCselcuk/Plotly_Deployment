# Plotly_Deployment

The goal of this analysis is to create a dynamic panel that includes demographic information and bacterial data for each volunteer. The analysis includes three charts: a bar chart that illustrates the top 10 bacteria cultures found in the belly button, a bubble chart that displays the amount of bacteria cultures per sample, and a gauge chart that indictes the number of times a volunteer washes his or her belly button. By choosing a volunteer (UTO ID) in the dropdown menu, users can view the differences across multiple test subjects.

## Summary
In this project, I used Javascript's Plotly library to create three basic plots: horizontal bar chart, gauge chart, and bubble chart. I used D3.json to fetch external data and Javascript functional programming to manipulate the data. I added event handlers to add interactivity to this data visualization. Charts are built once a user selects a sample ID number from the drop-down menu options. Finally, I deployed this interactive chart via GitHub Pages.
